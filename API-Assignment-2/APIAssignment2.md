# API LAB

## Overview

#### 1. Send your first request:
##### Can you tell us in your own word what happened after making your first request?

Ans: I sent a get request to postman-echo.com/get from postman. So, postman is acting as client and postman-echo/get is 
acting as API server. After getting the above request, API server processed it and respond back to postman. At last 
postman received the response and displayed in the response body.

Ans: I have written the bash script named "getapi.sh":

```shell
#!/bin/bash
curl -o users.json https://reqres.in/api/users/3
curl -o planets.json https://swapi.dev/api/planets/3/
curl -o emplyee.json http://dummy.restapiexample.com/api/v1/employee/3
curl -o ping.json https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/ping
curl -o vehicles.json https://swapi.dev/api/vehicles/schema/
```
Then I ran the bash script by following command

$ sh getapi.sh 

And I found all the .json output in the directory. Those files are available with this directory.
